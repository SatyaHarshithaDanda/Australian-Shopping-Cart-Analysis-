# 🛒 FSDA: Analysis of Shopping Cart Data
## 📌 Project Description
This project is part of a Full Stack Data Analytics (FSDA) initiative aimed at exploring consumer behavior through shopping cart transaction data. By analyzing features such as product sales, locations, customer preferences, and time patterns, this project uncovers actionable insights that can help optimize retail strategies, inventory management, and customer experience.
Using real-world shopping data, the analysis provides a comprehensive look into **when**, **where**, and **what** customers are purchasing—highlighting trends across **states**, **cities**, **products**, and **months**.

- Perform thorough data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Analyze sales patterns across time (monthly trends).
- Identify top-performing **states**, **cities**, and **products** by sales volume.
- Detect underperforming categories and suggest optimization opportunities.
- Visualize key insights using bar plots, heatmaps, and trend lines.
- Understand the correlation between variables and customer purchasing behavior.
